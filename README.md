Photometric dataset acquisition process with mobile camera

Mirrorball calibration: calibrate the light source position with mirror ball 
- input: real sphere radius, image sphere radius, image specular point
- output: light source position on camera coordinate


Intensity calibration: calibrate the light intensity distribtuion with spectralon
Spectralon is the thing which diffuse 99% light. 
- input: spectralon raw image
- output: r - intensity graph
